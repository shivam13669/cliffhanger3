					<description><![CDATA[Today, I went to the beachfront with my children. I found a sea shell and gave it to my 4 year old daughter and said &quot;You can hear the ocean if you put this to your ear.&quot; She put the shell to her ear and screamed. There was a hermit crab inside and it pinched her ear. She never wants to go back! LoL I know this is totally off topic but I had to tell someone!]]></description>
